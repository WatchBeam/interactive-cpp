# Xbox Sample

## Interactive Project

We don't have generic project import support in the [Interactive Studio](https://beam.pro/i/studio) yet (although it's on the docket!), so you'll have to
create your own project and incorporate it into the sample.

These json documents and screenshots represent the example interactive project used
in the Xbox sample. Please create a project similar in structure, or edit the sample
to reflect the interactive project you author.

Once you have a project created, replace the Interactive Project Id in the sample with
your own - the global variable "s_interactiveVersion" in Interactivity.cpp. You can get
your project id in the Interactive Studio ([see example screenshot here](https://github.com/WatchBeam/interactive-sdk-cpp/Samples/Xbox/ExampleProject/Screenshots/interactive_project_id.png)).
